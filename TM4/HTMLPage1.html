Class:-
	constructor
	type of constructor
	destructor
-----------------------------------------------
Property:-  A  C# class variable also called property,  to read and write  value in property , we can use get and set keyword , called getter and setter. A class variable has by default no accessor.  so if we want read only, we can use get keyword or read and write both we can use get/set both.
------------------------------------------------
Indexer:- A indexer is the virtual array, which allow to read and write class variables like array.
	A indexer permits get/set accessor.

Note:  a class can container more than one indexer , called index overloading.
--------------------------------------


Inheritance:-
Base keyword:-
Sealed keyword:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polymarphims:- Polymarphism is the technique to provide multiple behaviour  to single object.
                                 where Poly=> Many , Morphism=> Forms.
	            it is two type.
		1- Compile time polymarphism
		2- Run-time Polymarphism
	----------------------------------------------------------------

	1- Compile Time Polymarphism:-  This type polymarphism done before compilation of program.  it is also called early binding
	Exa: Overloading
	--------------------------------------------------------------------
Overloading:- Overloading is the technique to create more than one version of object.
	 so we can overload methods by changeing arguments type and count every time.
	it means we can implement one method many time in a class , by changing arguments 	type and count.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	2- Run-time polymarphims:-  this type of polymarphism done  at the time program execution, there is the no idea to compiler what is the final code execution. it is also called late binding.
	Exa: Overriding
Overriding: -Overriding is the technique to modify base class  member into drived class. here base class method will be virtual and drived class method use override keyword to override method.

Interview Question:-

Difference Between overloading and Overriding ?

find atleast 5 differences ?
